sbt-git-stamp
=============



An SBT plugin that add some basic git data to the artefact's `MANIFEST.MF` file.

We cannot take the credit for the idea of this plugin as the source is a fork from Patrick Kaeding's [creation](https://bitbucket.org/pkaeding/sbt-git-stamp)

## What it does ##

A plugin including some basic information about the state of the repository that the artifact was built from,
at the time it was built.  This information includes:

* Head revision
* Branch name
* Whether or not there were uncommitted changes
* Build date

This information is included in the `MANIFEST.MF` file in the jar produced by the `package` (or `assembly`) tasks.  This can
help you track down where a build came from.

## How to use it ##

### Sbt 1.x

Since major version 6, this plugin is cross compiled for sbt 1.x (specifically 1.3.4).

| Sbt version | Plugin version |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| `0.13.x`  | `any`          |
| `>= 1.x`    | `>= 6.x`       |

Add the following to your `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.url("hmrc-sbt-plugin-releases",
  url("https://dl.bintray.com/hmrc/sbt-plugin-releases"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)

addSbtPlugin("uk.gov.hmrc" % "sbt-git-stamp" % "INSERT_VERSION")
```

Add the following near the top of your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
  import uk.gov.hmrc.gitstamp.GitStampPlugin._
```

Then, add this lower down:

```scala
  Seq(gitStampSettings: _*)
```

Then, just build as normal. This plugin won't add any tasks, or otherwise change the way you interact with SBT.

Your artifacts will just come out with a `MANIFEST.MF` file that looks something like this:

```
  Manifest-Version: 1.0
  Implementation-Vendor: My-Company
  Implementation-Title: My Project
  Implementation-Version: 0.1
  Implementation-Vendor-Id: My-Company
  Specification-Vendor: My-Company
  Git-Repo-Is-Clean: false
  Git-Branch: gitstamp
  Specification-Title: My Company
  Git-Build-Date: 2013-04-26T17:22:58.538-07:00
  Specification-Version: 0.1
  Git-Head-Rev: b0d5a67d59dc7c0133aecce2e2ceb18fc8d23597
  Git-Describe: release/0.3.5-b0d5a67
```

The entries starting with `Git-` were added by this plugin.
